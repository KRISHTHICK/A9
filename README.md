create a chatbot with the functionality you described, you'll need to integrate several features into your application. Here's a roadmap to implement it:

Requirements:
File Upload: Allow users to upload a PDF file.
Generate URL: Create a unique URL for the uploaded PDF (e.g., hosted on a server or cloud storage).
Generate ZIP File: Compress the uploaded PDF into a ZIP file.
Generate QR Code: Create a QR code that links to the file's URL.
Sharing Options:
Email the file or link.
Share the file or link via WhatsApp to a specific number.
Technologies:
Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI), Node.js, or any equivalent backend framework.
Frontend: React.js, Angular, or Vue.js for the chatbot interface.
Storage: Cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for hosting files.
Libraries/Tools:
File handling: os, zipfile, or equivalent.
QR code generation: qrcode (Python) or qrcode-generator (JavaScript).
Email: smtplib (Python) or nodemailer (Node.js).
WhatsApp messaging: WhatsApp API (via Twilio or Meta's WhatsApp Business API).
Implementation Steps:
Backend:
File Upload Endpoint:

Accept PDF files via a POST request.
Store the files on the server or upload them to a cloud storage bucket.
Generate a public URL for the file.
Generate ZIP File:

Compress the uploaded PDF into a ZIP file using file handling libraries.
Generate QR Code:

Use a QR code library to create a QR code linking to the URL.
Serve the QR code as an image.
Send Email:

Configure an email service to send the file's link or ZIP file.
Use libraries like smtplib, nodemailer, or cloud email services like SendGrid.
WhatsApp Sharing:

Use the WhatsApp API to send the file or link to a specific number.
Implement the API to send pre-filled WhatsApp messages.
Frontend:
Chatbot UI:

Build a chatbot interface using a framework like React.js or Vue.js.
Include options for "Upload PDF", "Generate QR Code", "Email", and "WhatsApp".
Integration:

Connect the chatbot to backend APIs for uploading files, creating URLs, and sharing options.
WhatsApp Direct Sharing:

Use https://wa.me/<number> for direct sharing with WhatsApp Web or WhatsApp App.
Example Code:
QR Code Generation (Python):
Python
import qrcode

def generate_qr_code(file_url):
    qr = qrcode.QRCode(
        version=1,
        error_correction=qrcode.constants.ERROR_CORRECT_L,
        box_size=10,
        border=4,
    )
    qr.add_data(file_url)
    qr.make(fit=True)

    img = qr.make_image(fill_color="black", back_color="white")
    img.save("qrcode.png")
File Sharing via Email (Python):
Python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.base import MIMEBase
from email import encoders

def send_email(to_email, subject, body, file_path=None):
    sender_email = "your_email@example.com"
    sender_password = "your_password"

    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = sender_email
    msg['To'] = to_email
    msg['Subject'] = subject

    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

    if file_path:
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as attachment:
            part = MIMEBase('application', 'octet-stream')
            part.set_payload(attachment.read())
        encoders.encode_base64(part)
        part.add_header(
            'Content-Disposition',
            f'attachment; filename={file_path.split("/")[-1]}',
        )
        msg.attach(part)

    with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com', 587) as server:
        server.starttls()
        server.login(sender_email, sender_password)
        server.sendmail(sender_email, to_email, msg.as_string())
WhatsApp Sharing Link:
JavaScript
function shareViaWhatsApp(number, message) {
    const url = `https://wa.me/${number}?text=${encodeURIComponent(message)}`;
    window.open(url, '_blank');
}
